### Personalized migraine prediction using variability in weather conditions: an observational diary-based analysis

## Objective
The objective of this diary-based analysis was to develop a personalized approach to migraine risk modeling which explains weather variability as a migraine trigger in chronic and episodic migraineurs.

## Background
Weather has been hypothesized to alter the risk of migraine, but supportive evidence is limited and little is known about the influence of weather on individual level differences from the average migraineur. This study presents a personalized approach to migraine risk modeling and applies it to model the relationship of variability in weather and risk.

## Methods
We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to incorporate individual and population averaged effects for the risk factors of migraine using electronic headache diaries. Posterior distributions of model parameters were used to predict risk of migraine events for the participants, and easy to interpret visualizations of predictions were created to study the practical impacts on individuals.

## Results
Personalized weather models improved prediction accuracy by 4.47% (95% CI = 3.46, 5.49) for episodic and 5.54% (95% CI = 2.37, 8.7) for chronic migraineurs, meaning that according to our model, an additional ~5% of migraine events can be correctly predicted by weather variability. Variability in weather has a Goldilocks effect on risk where the extremes of variability increase risk and moderate amounts do not alter risk. Individuals who experience periods of no change and periods of extreme change in weather are at the highest risk. Given typical weather conditions for each individual, we predict risk in excess of 30% and 60% for the most affected episodic and chronic migraineurs, respectively. Visualization of predictions show highly individualized effects of weather on migraine.

## Conclusions
This observational diary-based study exposes the non-linear relationship between weather variability and risk of migraine, and the importance of individual impacts of variability on risk. Our personalized migraine risk model shows promise in explaining important factors which contribute to migraine, and it can help individuals with migraine predict their risk and specific events given local changes in weather conditions.
